# ACM OSS VIM Intro Workshop

This repository was used for the Intro to VIM Workshop, 
conducted by the Open Source Software Team at ACM CSUF! 
It contains the file `sample.txt`, which was used to go 
over the basics of VIM Keybinds (motions, how to edit and 
highlight text, etc.)

## Setup

You can begin by cloning the repository on your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomasohCHOM/vim-intro-workshop.git
cd vim-intro-workshop
```

Follow along by either opening the directory with **VIM** 
(using the `vim .` alias), or with any other IDE (like 
VSCode with the VIM Extension).
