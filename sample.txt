ACM OSS VIM Intro Workshop

Welcome to the sample file used to conduct the Intro to VIM 
Workshop! If you are seeing this, chances are you were able 
to set up VIM (or the VSCode VIM Keybinds Extension) on your 
machine. Congrats! You can use this file to practice your VIM 
motions, and your ability to edit text with tis tool.
Let's get started:

You can start by moving around while in NORMAL mode. h, j, k, l 
all move the cursor one character at a time. 

There is quite some space from the line below to the next one. Use 
relative lines to jump from this line to the one 9 lines below.








Nice!
