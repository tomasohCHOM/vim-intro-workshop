ACM OSS VIM Intro Workshop

Welcome to the sample file used to conduct the Intro to VIM 
Workshop! If you are seeing this, chances are you were able 
to set up VIM (or the VSCode VIM Keybinds Extension) on your 
machine. Congrats! You can use this file to practice your VIM 
motions, and your ability to edit text with tis tool.
Let's get started:

You can start by moving around while in NORMAL mode. h, j, k, l 
all move the cursor one character at a time. w moves per word,
b goes one word BACKWARDS.

There is quite some space from the line below to the next one. Use 
relative lines to jump from THIS line to the one 9 lines below.








Nice! Keep this concept in mind. We will use it in a bit.

We can use x while in NORMAL to delete one character at a time.
There are some typos in the line below. Let's fix it!

Hello pOpen Source fSoftware xTeam!


Delete the line below (with dd):

VIM Sucks hehehehe.

You can paste what you deleted with p. yy copies the entire line.
Undo the last action with u (Ctrl-R to redo).

Let's insert some text. Between the dashed line, enter INSERT 
mode and add some text. Press Esc to go back to NORMAL.

Now, let's learn how to highlight in VIM!
v enters VISUAL mode, immediately highlighting text from where 
you start. y copies the highlighted area, d cuts it.

Below, go to the beginning of the line highlight it, and copy it.
Paste it below it:

HIGHLIGHT MEEEEEEEEE!



Tedious, no? Try Capital V instead! It highlights the entire line 
(including the newline character). Use it in the line below.

HIGHLIGHT ME IN VISUAL LINE!

[PASTE IN THIS LINE. It actually does it in the line below.]


Let's do something more advanced. Try to highlight all the following lines 
without repeating jjjjjjjjjjj (HINT: Relative Line Jumping):

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod 
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ipsum nunc aliquet 
bibendum enim facilisis gravida neque. Ut consequat semper viverra nam 
libero justo laoreet sit amet. Vitae elementum curabitur vitae nunc sed 
velit dignissim. Pretium fusce id velit ut tortor pretium viverra. Morbi 
tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis. Justo donec enim 
diam vulputate ut pharetra sit amet aliquam. Eget duis at tellus at urna 
condimentum mattis. Elit scelerisque mauris pellentesque pulvinar. Parturient 
montes nascetur ridiculus mus mauris vitae ultricies leo integer. Eu tincidunt 
tortor aliquam nulla facilisi cras fermentum odio. Nisl purus in mollis nunc sed 
id semper risus. Elit ut aliquam purus sit. Habitant morbi tristique senectus et 
netus. Et sollicitudin ac orci phasellus egestas tellus rutrum tellus. Ut lectus 
arcu bibendum at varius.


Awesome! Last thing is COMMAND mode. Type ':', then you can do 
'w' to save the file, '12' to go to line 12, or 'q' to quit VIM.
':q!' quits without saving the file.

That's it! This concludes the VIM Demo for the VIM Motions Workshop.
Thanks for sticking through :>

Keep grinding, never give up!
